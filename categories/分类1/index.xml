      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a Theoretical Computer Science (TCS) phd student in The Institute for Logic, Language and Computation (ILLC).
In 2022, I graduated from LSE with a M.S. in Logic.
I like bouldering, ping-pong, skateboarding and smashing drum set at my spare time. Playing not bad.
My girlfriend has been with me for 3 months. We all settled down in Amsterdam, Netherlands.
And my favourite character is Snoopy. We look alike!</description>
